Method1. Download the data* SRR file of Arabidopsis thaliana has been downloaded using Preftech command.* SRA file has been converted to fatstq file using fastq-dump –split-3 command2. Trimming of reads* At first fastq files were converted into fastqc file using fastqc -f fastq -o command, to check the quality of data.* fastqc files were moved to computer using sftp to check the quality of html files.* Adapter sequence of these fastq files were trimmed using cutadapt* adapter sequence GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG and GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG were used to control the quality of the data.* Quality of trimmed files were also checked my copying file to the desktop using sftp.3. Aligning data reads using BWA* bwa was installed.* index file was created using bwa index command.* Reads were aligned using bwa mem command which resulted in the sam file.* samtool was installed.* sam file was converted to bam file using samtools view -S -b command.* bam file was then converted into sorted bam using samtools sort command.* samtools flagstat  command used to output the mapping statistics.
